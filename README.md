# GraphQL
# Introduction
GraphQL is an open source data query and manipulation language for API. It was developed internally by Facebook coorporation in 2012.GraphQL is a query language to build client application by providing flexible and intuitive syntax for asking the data requirements.

# Objective
It was developed to optimize RESTFUL API calls. And provide s flexibilty,robust and more effiecient alternative to REST.

# Why GraphQL

-> It overcome the problem of problem of Over-Fetching or Under-Fetching.With GraphQL, developers can fetch only what is required. Nothing less, nothing more. This solves the issues that arise due to over-fetching and under-fetching.

-> GraphQL allows making multiple resources request in a single query call, which saves a lot of time and bandwidth by reducing the number of network round trips to the server. It also helps to save waterfall network requests, where our need to resolve dependent resources on previous requests. 

-> With GraphQL, there is no need to maintain versions. The resource URL or address remains the same. You can add new fields and deprecate older fields. This approach is intuitive as the client receives a deprecation warning when querying a deprecated field.
